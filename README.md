# Decision Tree on Titanic Dataset

## Description
This project involves using a Decision Tree classifier to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and it provides an excellent opportunity to practice data preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying machine learning algorithms. Understanding decision trees is crucial for building interpretable models and is a foundation for more complex ensemble methods.
